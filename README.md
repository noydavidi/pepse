**Pepse**

A 2D endless runner game where the player controls an avatar that runs through a procedurally generated terrain.
The goal of the game is to run as far as possible without falling off the edge of the terrain.

**Background**

This game was created by Noy Davidi as a project for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, OPP course.
I enjoyed working on this project and found it to be a challenging and rewarding experience.
I learned a lot about procedural generation, game development, and software engineering.

**Gameplay**

The player controls the avatar using the keyboard arrows. The avatar will automatically run forward. The player can jump by pressing the spacebar.
The terrain is procedurally generated, so the player will never run the same course twice. The terrain is made up of blocks, and the player must avoid falling off the edge of the blocks.
The player can also collect coins by running over them. Coins can be used to purchase power-ups, such as a jetpack or a shield.
The game ends when the player falls off the edge of the terrain. The player's score is based on how far they ran and how many coins they collected.

Move right: Right arrow
