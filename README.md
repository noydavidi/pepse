**Pepse**

A 2D endless runner game where the player controls an avatar that runs through a procedurally generated terrain.
The goal of the game is to run as far as possible without falling off the edge of the terrain.

**Background**

This game was created by Noy Davidi as a project for the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, OPP course.
I enjoyed working on this project and found it to be a challenging and rewarding experience.
I learned a lot about procedural generation, game development, and software engineering.

**Gameplay**

The player controls the avatar, a little creature, using the keyboard arrows. The avatar can walk, run, jump, and fly.
The game world is procedurally generated, so the player will never run the same course twice. The game world is made up of trees, ground, and stairs. The trees' leaves fall and regrow, and the sun's position in the sky changes, creating a dynamic lighting system that makes the game world feel more realistic.
The player has an energy level for the flying mood. The energy level decreases when the player is flying. When the energy level reaches 0, the player can no longer fly. The player can recharge the energy level by walking. You can exit the game by pressing the escape button.

**Controls**

Move left: Left arrow
Move right: Right arrow
